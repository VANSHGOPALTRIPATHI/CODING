/* ABSTRACTION--> IT IS IMPLEMENTATION HINDIG SHOWS ONLY THE MAIN THING AND THE PR0CESS IS HIDED 
Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. 
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. 
Data abstraction refers to providing only necessary information about the outside worldâ€™s data, 
hiding the background details or implementation.

Advantages Of Abstraction
-->Only you can make changes to your data or function, and no one else can.
-->It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the background details.
-->Increases the reusability of the code.
-->Avoids duplication of your code.
